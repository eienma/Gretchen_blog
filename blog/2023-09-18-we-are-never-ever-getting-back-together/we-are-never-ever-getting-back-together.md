I remember when we broke up the first time

Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"

'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month

When you said you needed space

What?

Then you come around again and say

"Baby, I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"

Remember how that lasted for a day?

I say, "I hate you", we break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

We called it off again last night but

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together

We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights

And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right

And you would hide away and find your peace of mind

With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You called me up again tonight but

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We (we) are never, ever, ever getting back together

We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah!)

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah!)

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah!)

Oh-oh-oh!

I used to think that we were forever, ever

And I used to say, never say never

Pfft, so he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you"

And I'm like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting

You know, like we are never getting back together

Like, ever (no!)

We are never, ever, ever getting back together

We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Getting back together

We (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), oh

Getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
