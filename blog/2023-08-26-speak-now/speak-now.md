I am not the kind of girl

Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion

But you are not the kind of boy

Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends

And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel

And she is yelling at a bridesmaid

Somewhere back inside a room, wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be

I lose myself in a daydream

Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now

I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door

Don't wait or say a single vow

You need to hear me out, and they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged

And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march

And I am hiding in the curtains

It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen

But I know you wish it was me

You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now

I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door

Don't wait or say a single vow

You need to hear me out, and they said, "Speak now"

Don't say yes, run away now (run away now)

I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door

Don't wait, or say a single vow (say a single vow)

Your time is running out, and they said, "Speak now"

Ooh (run away) now

Ooh (say a single vow), ooh

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"

There's the silence, there's my last chance

I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me

Horrified looks from everyone in the room

But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl

Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion

But you are not the kind of boy

Who should be marrying the wrong girl

So don't say yes, run away now

I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door

Don't wait or say a single vow

You need to hear me out, they said, "Speak now"

You'll say, "Let's run away now (run away now)

I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door

Baby, I didn't say my vows (say a single vow)

So glad you were around when they said, 'Speak now'"
